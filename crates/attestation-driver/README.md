# Attestation Driver Impl Wrapper

Forked from https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack. All acknowledgments to Phala's team and contributors.

We fork solely the wrapper for the c external interface that interacts with the driver to apply a couple of small changes to the codebase (e.g conditional stub for building on macos).
